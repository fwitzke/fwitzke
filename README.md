Hi there :wave:

These days, I've been working as a Software Developer at [Mighty Networks](https://www.mightynetworks.com/), writing mostly Ruby and JavaScript.

Here are some other stuff I've also been doing recently:
- ðŸ§‰ [MateMateGo](https://matematego.com/): I've built this website to help people finding Yerba Mate online.
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· [Mariana Day Blog](https://marianaday.com): I'm also helping my wife with her personal blog, check it out.

You can reach me out through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fwitzke/).
