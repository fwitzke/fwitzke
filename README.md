Hi there, stranger :wave:

These days, I've been working as a Software Developer at [Precision Nutrition](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/), writing mostly Ruby, JavaScript and TypeScript.

Here are some other stuff I've also been doing recently:
- ðŸ§‰ [MateMateGo](https://matematego.com/): helping people to find Yerba Mate online.
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· [Mariana Day Blog](https://marianaday.com): also helping my wife with her personal blog.

You can reach me out through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fwitzke/).
